Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to \\u2026 He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest \\u2026 Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. \\\"Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough.\\\" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, \\\"Say law and order but with safety.\\\" I said, \\\"Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?\\\" We want law and order. They say, \\\"Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's \\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"I don't want to add.\\\" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, \\\"No, we need law and order.\\\" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at \\u2026 You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way \\u2026 By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, \\\"Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?\\\" There's something really \\u2026 The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, \\\"He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting.\\\" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think \\u2026 I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that \\u2026 So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, \\\"Look, let's have 1,000 people,\\\" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed \\u2026 Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, \\\"I don't know. That's a lot of \\u2026\\\" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done \\u2026 You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. \\\"Sir, we have to be able to see through.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, let's go. Much more expensive.\\\" I said, \\\"Let's go.\\\" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, \\\"What else do you want?\\\" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, \\\"We don't want a wall, we want drones flying.\\\" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about \\u2026 We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us \\u2026 We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders \\u2026 Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, \\\"That's a big number, right?\\\" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, \\\"You know the money that your state is going to be losing?\\\" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost \\u2013 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. \\\"After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed.\\\" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, \\\"Impossible.\\\" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with\\u2026 It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, \\\"Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?\\\" He said, \\\"Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.\\\" So I said, \\\"28, okay, that's fine.\\\" I said, \\\"We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.\\\" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want\\u2026 And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. \\\"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal.\\\" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, \\\"How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.\\\" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need\\u2026 There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, \\\"There's no way he got worse than me.\\\" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to\\u2026 That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, \\\"Okay.\\\" She could have said, \\\"You got me.\\\" But she said, \\\"I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,\\\" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, \\\"I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.\\\" I said, \\\"How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?\\\" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. \\\"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.\\\" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, \\\"Walls are old fashioned. They don't work.\\\" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, \\\"Let me see that one.\\\" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, \\\"No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be\\u2026\\\" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, \\\"No, no, no, you don't have to do that.\\\" But I said, \\\"We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,\\\" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment\\u2026He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, \\\"That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,\\\" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, \\\"You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people.\\\" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- \\u2026 And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them\\u2026 We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, \\\"You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.\\\" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, \\\"Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America\\u2026 So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting\\u2026 Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some\\u2026 We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, \\\"Wow, things are going really well.\\\" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. \",\n          \"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for \\u2026 I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, \\\"You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\\\" He said, \\\"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\\\" This great congressman said, \\\"I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot.\\\" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than \\u2026 Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor \\u2026 You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, \\\"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\\\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, \\\" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters.\\\" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star \\u2026 So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, \\\"Ah, I'm out of here. Bye.\\\" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, \\\" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small.\\\" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, \\\"Rob Portman's down,\\\" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, \\\"What the Hell did you do?\\\" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, \\\"I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump.\\\" I'd never have been in\\u2026 We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" 148. And I said, \\\"You got to be kidding.\\\" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, \\\"You must win the state of Ohio.\\\" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. \\\"You must win Ohio. You must win.\\\" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, \\\"Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.\\\" I said, \\\"But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.\\\" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, \\\"We just lost.\\\" And Bob said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up.\\\" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, \\\"Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried.\\\" He said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up.\\\" He kept saying, \\\"You just went up.\\\" I said to somebody, \\\"I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.\\\" True. He said, \\\"Don't worry.\\\" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, \\\"We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world.\\\" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new\\u2026 It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get\\u2026 They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, \\\"Just sign right there.\\\" \\\"Oh, okay. I'll sign.\\\" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, \\\"I'd love to go to a rally.\\\" I said, \\\" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it.\\\" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, \\\"Would you please report back in four years from now.\\\" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens\\u2026 they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better\\u2026 I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, \\\"You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days.\\\" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, \\\"Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.\\\" I say, \\\"So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it.\\\" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, \\\"Gee, that's a good idea.\\\" They'd been working in this few years. They said, \\\"That's a good idea.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?\\\" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now\\u2026 So other countries\\u2026 Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, \\\"You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation.\\\" He said, \\\"If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%.\\\" I said, \\\"Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system\\u2026\\\" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, \\\"You know, I have a great idea.\\\" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for\\u2026 I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, \\\"I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill.\\\" And I thought\\u2026 I said, \\\"Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that.\\\" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, \\\"How do you like that idea?\\\" And they said, \\\"Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been\\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"Really? You've known about it that long?\\\" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got\\u2026 They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, \\\"Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in\\u2026 Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, \\\"We're closing this plant.\\\" I said, \\\"What kind of a plant is it?\\\" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, \\\"You mean Lima?\\\" They said, \\\"No, sir. It's Lima.\\\" That's why\\u2026 Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, \\\"What kind of a plant?\\\" And I said, \\\"Let's go see it.\\\" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, \\\"Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here.\\\" I said\\u2026 And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, \\\"You're not closing it.\\\" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to\\u2026 They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went\\u2026 They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our\\u2026 Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do\\u2026 A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, \\\"But I could do better. I could do better.\\\" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had\\u2026 The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words \\\"Made in the USA\\\" or \\\"Made in America\\\". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God We trust.\\\" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was\\u2026 I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. And we all share the same love of Almighty God. Together, with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. We are making America great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep America great. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":58}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Creazione di una lista contenente le abbreviazioni dei mesi come riportati nella colonna nome del file\n","mesi = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']\n","mesi"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"R9JnABzxksdW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711828977306,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"John Jordan Ntamack","userId":"04516984341154908365"}},"outputId":"8efec9ef-a910-4042-e42a-0218f1ff0a2d"},"execution_count":59,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Jan',\n"," 'Feb',\n"," 'Mar',\n"," 'Apr',\n"," 'May',\n"," 'Jun',\n"," 'Jul',\n"," 'Aug',\n"," 'Sep',\n"," 'Oct',\n"," 'Nov',\n"," 'Dec']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":59}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Funzione che ci permette di recuperare il nome della citt√†\n","def SeparaCitta(c):\n","  for m in mesi:\n","    if (m in c):\n","      citta = c[:c.find(m)]\n","  return citta"],"metadata":{"id":"EAocxpPInrMQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711828977306,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"John Jordan Ntamack","userId":"04516984341154908365"}}},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Creazione di una colonna Citt√†\n","df['Citta'] = df.Nome_del_file.apply(SeparaCitta)\n","df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"5LxPHMsHpD_F","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711828978221,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":920,"user":{"displayName":"John Jordan Ntamack","userId":"04516984341154908365"}},"outputId":"a377975b-96ac-4492-b10f-85989f162891"},"execution_count":61,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                     Nome_del_file  \\\n","0         CharlestonFeb28_2020.txt   \n","1            HersheyDec10_2019.txt   \n","2   ColoradorSpringsFeb20_2020.txt   \n","3              TexasSep23_2019.txt   \n","4       NewHampshireAug15_2019.txt   \n","5           CharlotteMar2_2020.txt   \n","6           WildwoodJan28_2020.txt   \n","7             DallasOct17_2019.txt   \n","8            BemidjiSep18_2020.txt   \n","9        BattleCreekDec19_2019.txt   \n","10         NewMexicoSep16_2019.txt   \n","11      NewHampshireFeb10_2020.txt   \n","12        PittsburghSep22_2020.txt   \n","13             TulsaJun20_2020.txt   \n","14             TupeloNov1_2019.txt   \n","15             ToledoJan9_2020.txt   \n","16          LasVegasFeb21_2020.txt   \n","17         DesMoinesJan30_2020.txt   \n","18              YumaAug18_2020.txt   \n","19            LatrobeSep3_2020.txt   \n","20       FayettevilleSep9_2019.txt   \n","21              OhioSep21_2020.txt   \n","22      NewHampshireAug28_2020.txt   \n","23          FreelandSep10_2020.txt   \n","24         CincinnatiAug1_2019.txt   \n","25           PhoenixFeb19_2020.txt   \n","26      Winston-SalemSep8_2020.txt   \n","27          LexingtonNov4_2019.txt   \n","28      FayettevilleSep19_2020.txt   \n","29        GreenvilleJul17_2019.txt   \n","30       MinneapolisOct10_2019.txt   \n","31         MilwaukeeJan14_2020.txt   \n","32         HendersonSep13_2020.txt   \n","33           MosineeSep17_2020.txt   \n","34            MindenSep12_2020.txt   \n","\n","                                            Contenuto             Citta  \n","0   Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to \\u2026 He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest \\u2026 Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. \\\"Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough.\\\" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, \\\"Say law and order but with safety.\\\" I said, \\\"Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?\\\" We want law and order. They say, \\\"Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's \\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"I don't want to add.\\\" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, \\\"No, we need law and order.\\\" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at \\u2026 You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way \\u2026 By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, \\\"Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?\\\" There's something really \\u2026 The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, \\\"He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting.\\\" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think \\u2026 I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that \\u2026 So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, \\\"Look, let's have 1,000 people,\\\" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed \\u2026 Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, \\\"I don't know. That's a lot of \\u2026\\\" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done \\u2026 You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. \\\"Sir, we have to be able to see through.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, let's go. Much more expensive.\\\" I said, \\\"Let's go.\\\" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, \\\"What else do you want?\\\" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, \\\"We don't want a wall, we want drones flying.\\\" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about \\u2026 We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us \\u2026 We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders \\u2026 Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, \\\"That's a big number, right?\\\" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, \\\"You know the money that your state is going to be losing?\\\" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost \\u2013 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. \\\"After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed.\\\" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, \\\"Impossible.\\\" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with\\u2026 It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, \\\"Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?\\\" He said, \\\"Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.\\\" So I said, \\\"28, okay, that's fine.\\\" I said, \\\"We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.\\\" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want\\u2026 And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. \\\"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal.\\\" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, \\\"How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.\\\" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need\\u2026 There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, \\\"There's no way he got worse than me.\\\" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to\\u2026 That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, \\\"Okay.\\\" She could have said, \\\"You got me.\\\" But she said, \\\"I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,\\\" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, \\\"I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.\\\" I said, \\\"How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?\\\" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. \\\"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.\\\" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, \\\"Walls are old fashioned. They don't work.\\\" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, \\\"Let me see that one.\\\" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, \\\"No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be\\u2026\\\" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, \\\"No, no, no, you don't have to do that.\\\" But I said, \\\"We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,\\\" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment\\u2026He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, \\\"That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,\\\" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, \\\"You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people.\\\" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- \\u2026 And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them\\u2026 We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, \\\"You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.\\\" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, \\\"Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America\\u2026 So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting\\u2026 Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some\\u2026 We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, \\\"Wow, things are going really well.\\\" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. \",\n          \"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for \\u2026 I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, \\\"You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\\\" He said, \\\"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\\\" This great congressman said, \\\"I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot.\\\" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than \\u2026 Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor \\u2026 You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, \\\"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\\\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, \\\" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters.\\\" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star \\u2026 So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, \\\"Ah, I'm out of here. Bye.\\\" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, \\\" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small.\\\" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, \\\"Rob Portman's down,\\\" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, \\\"What the Hell did you do?\\\" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, \\\"I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump.\\\" I'd never have been in\\u2026 We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" 148. And I said, \\\"You got to be kidding.\\\" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, \\\"You must win the state of Ohio.\\\" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. \\\"You must win Ohio. You must win.\\\" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, \\\"Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.\\\" I said, \\\"But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.\\\" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, \\\"We just lost.\\\" And Bob said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up.\\\" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, \\\"Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried.\\\" He said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up.\\\" He kept saying, \\\"You just went up.\\\" I said to somebody, \\\"I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.\\\" True. He said, \\\"Don't worry.\\\" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, \\\"We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world.\\\" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new\\u2026 It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get\\u2026 They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, \\\"Just sign right there.\\\" \\\"Oh, okay. I'll sign.\\\" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, \\\"I'd love to go to a rally.\\\" I said, \\\" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it.\\\" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, \\\"Would you please report back in four years from now.\\\" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens\\u2026 they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better\\u2026 I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, \\\"You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days.\\\" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, \\\"Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.\\\" I say, \\\"So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it.\\\" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, \\\"Gee, that's a good idea.\\\" They'd been working in this few years. They said, \\\"That's a good idea.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?\\\" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now\\u2026 So other countries\\u2026 Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, \\\"You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation.\\\" He said, \\\"If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%.\\\" I said, \\\"Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system\\u2026\\\" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, \\\"You know, I have a great idea.\\\" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for\\u2026 I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, \\\"I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill.\\\" And I thought\\u2026 I said, \\\"Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that.\\\" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, \\\"How do you like that idea?\\\" And they said, \\\"Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been\\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"Really? You've known about it that long?\\\" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got\\u2026 They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, \\\"Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in\\u2026 Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, \\\"We're closing this plant.\\\" I said, \\\"What kind of a plant is it?\\\" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, \\\"You mean Lima?\\\" They said, \\\"No, sir. It's Lima.\\\" That's why\\u2026 Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, \\\"What kind of a plant?\\\" And I said, \\\"Let's go see it.\\\" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, \\\"Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here.\\\" I said\\u2026 And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, \\\"You're not closing it.\\\" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to\\u2026 They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went\\u2026 They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our\\u2026 Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do\\u2026 A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, \\\"But I could do better. I could do better.\\\" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had\\u2026 The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words \\\"Made in the USA\\\" or \\\"Made in America\\\". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God We trust.\\\" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was\\u2026 I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home.

Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to \\u2026 He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest \\u2026 Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. \\\"Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough.\\\" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, \\\"Say law and order but with safety.\\\" I said, \\\"Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?\\\" We want law and order. They say, \\\"Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's \\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"I don't want to add.\\\" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, \\\"No, we need law and order.\\\" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at \\u2026 You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way \\u2026 By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, \\\"Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?\\\" There's something really \\u2026 The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, \\\"He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting.\\\" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think \\u2026 I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that \\u2026 So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, \\\"Look, let's have 1,000 people,\\\" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed \\u2026 Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, \\\"I don't know. That's a lot of \\u2026\\\" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done \\u2026 You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. \\\"Sir, we have to be able to see through.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, let's go. Much more expensive.\\\" I said, \\\"Let's go.\\\" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, \\\"What else do you want?\\\" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, \\\"We don't want a wall, we want drones flying.\\\" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about \\u2026 We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us \\u2026 We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders \\u2026 Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, \\\"That's a big number, right?\\\" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, \\\"You know the money that your state is going to be losing?\\\" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost \\u2013 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. \\\"After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed.\\\" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, \\\"Impossible.\\\" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with\\u2026 It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, \\\"Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?\\\" He said, \\\"Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.\\\" So I said, \\\"28, okay, that's fine.\\\" I said, \\\"We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.\\\" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want\\u2026 And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. \\\"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal.\\\" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, \\\"How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.\\\" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need\\u2026 There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, \\\"There's no way he got worse than me.\\\" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to\\u2026 That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, \\\"Okay.\\\" She could have said, \\\"You got me.\\\" But she said, \\\"I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,\\\" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, \\\"I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.\\\" I said, \\\"How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?\\\" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. \\\"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.\\\" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, \\\"Walls are old fashioned. They don't work.\\\" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, \\\"Let me see that one.\\\" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, \\\"No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be\\u2026\\\" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, \\\"No, no, no, you don't have to do that.\\\" But I said, \\\"We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,\\\" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment\\u2026He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, \\\"That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,\\\" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, \\\"You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people.\\\" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- \\u2026 And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them\\u2026 We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, \\\"You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.\\\" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, \\\"Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America\\u2026 So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting\\u2026 Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some\\u2026 We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, \\\"Wow, things are going really well.\\\" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. \",\n          \"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for \\u2026 I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, \\\"You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\\\" He said, \\\"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\\\" This great congressman said, \\\"I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot.\\\" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than \\u2026 Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor \\u2026 You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, \\\"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\\\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, \\\" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters.\\\" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star \\u2026 So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, \\\"Ah, I'm out of here. Bye.\\\" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, \\\" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small.\\\" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, \\\"Rob Portman's down,\\\" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, \\\"What the Hell did you do?\\\" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, \\\"I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump.\\\" I'd never have been in\\u2026 We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" 148. And I said, \\\"You got to be kidding.\\\" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, \\\"You must win the state of Ohio.\\\" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. \\\"You must win Ohio. You must win.\\\" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, \\\"Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.\\\" I said, \\\"But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.\\\" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, \\\"We just lost.\\\" And Bob said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up.\\\" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, \\\"Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried.\\\" He said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up.\\\" He kept saying, \\\"You just went up.\\\" I said to somebody, \\\"I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.\\\" True. He said, \\\"Don't worry.\\\" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, \\\"We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world.\\\" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new\\u2026 It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get\\u2026 They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, \\\"Just sign right there.\\\" \\\"Oh, okay. I'll sign.\\\" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, \\\"I'd love to go to a rally.\\\" I said, \\\" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it.\\\" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, \\\"Would you please report back in four years from now.\\\" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens\\u2026 they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better\\u2026 I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, \\\"You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days.\\\" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, \\\"Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.\\\" I say, \\\"So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it.\\\" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, \\\"Gee, that's a good idea.\\\" They'd been working in this few years. They said, \\\"That's a good idea.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?\\\" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now\\u2026 So other countries\\u2026 Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, \\\"You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation.\\\" He said, \\\"If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%.\\\" I said, \\\"Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system\\u2026\\\" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, \\\"You know, I have a great idea.\\\" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for\\u2026 I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, \\\"I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill.\\\" And I thought\\u2026 I said, \\\"Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that.\\\" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, \\\"How do you like that idea?\\\" And they said, \\\"Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been\\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"Really? You've known about it that long?\\\" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got\\u2026 They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, \\\"Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in\\u2026 Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, \\\"We're closing this plant.\\\" I said, \\\"What kind of a plant is it?\\\" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, \\\"You mean Lima?\\\" They said, \\\"No, sir. It's Lima.\\\" That's why\\u2026 Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, \\\"What kind of a plant?\\\" And I said, \\\"Let's go see it.\\\" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, \\\"Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here.\\\" I said\\u2026 And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, \\\"You're not closing it.\\\" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to\\u2026 They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went\\u2026 They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our\\u2026 Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do\\u2026 A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, \\\"But I could do better. I could do better.\\\" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had\\u2026 The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words \\\"Made in the USA\\\" or \\\"Made in America\\\". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God We trust.\\\" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was\\u2026 I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. And we all share the same love of Almighty God. Together, with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. We are making America great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep America great. Thank you, Ohio.

Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to \\u2026 He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest \\u2026 Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. \\\"Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough.\\\" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, \\\"Say law and order but with safety.\\\" I said, \\\"Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?\\\" We want law and order. They say, \\\"Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's \\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"I don't want to add.\\\" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, \\\"No, we need law and order.\\\" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at \\u2026 You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way \\u2026 By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, \\\"Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?\\\" There's something really \\u2026 The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, \\\"He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting.\\\" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think \\u2026 I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that \\u2026 So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, \\\"Look, let's have 1,000 people,\\\" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed \\u2026 Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, \\\"I don't know. That's a lot of \\u2026\\\" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done \\u2026 You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. \\\"Sir, we have to be able to see through.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, let's go. Much more expensive.\\\" I said, \\\"Let's go.\\\" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, \\\"What else do you want?\\\" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, \\\"We don't want a wall, we want drones flying.\\\" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about \\u2026 We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us \\u2026 We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders \\u2026 Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, \\\"That's a big number, right?\\\" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, \\\"You know the money that your state is going to be losing?\\\" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost \\u2013 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. \\\"After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed.\\\" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, \\\"Impossible.\\\" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with\\u2026 It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, \\\"Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?\\\" He said, \\\"Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.\\\" So I said, \\\"28, okay, that's fine.\\\" I said, \\\"We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.\\\" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want\\u2026 And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. \\\"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal.\\\" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, \\\"How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.\\\" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need\\u2026 There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, \\\"There's no way he got worse than me.\\\" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to\\u2026 That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, \\\"Okay.\\\" She could have said, \\\"You got me.\\\" But she said, \\\"I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,\\\" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, \\\"I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.\\\" I said, \\\"How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?\\\" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. \\\"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.\\\" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, \\\"Walls are old fashioned. They don't work.\\\" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, \\\"Let me see that one.\\\" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, \\\"No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be\\u2026\\\" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, \\\"No, no, no, you don't have to do that.\\\" But I said, \\\"We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,\\\" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment\\u2026He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, \\\"That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,\\\" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, \\\"You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people.\\\" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- \\u2026 And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them\\u2026 We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, \\\"You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.\\\" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, \\\"Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America\\u2026 So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting\\u2026 Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some\\u2026 We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, \\\"Wow, things are going really well.\\\" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. \",\n          \"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for \\u2026 I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, \\\"You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\\\" He said, \\\"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\\\" This great congressman said, \\\"I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot.\\\" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than \\u2026 Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor \\u2026 You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, \\\"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\\\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, \\\" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters.\\\" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star \\u2026 So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, \\\"Ah, I'm out of here. Bye.\\\" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, \\\" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small.\\\" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, \\\"Rob Portman's down,\\\" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, \\\"What the Hell did you do?\\\" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, \\\"I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump.\\\" I'd never have been in\\u2026 We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" 148. And I said, \\\"You got to be kidding.\\\" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, \\\"You must win the state of Ohio.\\\" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. \\\"You must win Ohio. You must win.\\\" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, \\\"Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.\\\" I said, \\\"But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.\\\" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, \\\"We just lost.\\\" And Bob said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up.\\\" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, \\\"Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried.\\\" He said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up.\\\" He kept saying, \\\"You just went up.\\\" I said to somebody, \\\"I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.\\\" True. He said, \\\"Don't worry.\\\" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, \\\"We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world.\\\" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new\\u2026 It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get\\u2026 They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, \\\"Just sign right there.\\\" \\\"Oh, okay. I'll sign.\\\" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, \\\"I'd love to go to a rally.\\\" I said, \\\" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it.\\\" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, \\\"Would you please report back in four years from now.\\\" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens\\u2026 they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better\\u2026 I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, \\\"You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days.\\\" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, \\\"Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.\\\" I say, \\\"So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it.\\\" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, \\\"Gee, that's a good idea.\\\" They'd been working in this few years. They said, \\\"That's a good idea.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?\\\" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now\\u2026 So other countries\\u2026 Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, \\\"You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation.\\\" He said, \\\"If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%.\\\" I said, \\\"Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system\\u2026\\\" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, \\\"You know, I have a great idea.\\\" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for\\u2026 I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, \\\"I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill.\\\" And I thought\\u2026 I said, \\\"Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that.\\\" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, \\\"How do you like that idea?\\\" And they said, \\\"Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been\\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"Really? You've known about it that long?\\\" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got\\u2026 They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, \\\"Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in\\u2026 Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, \\\"We're closing this plant.\\\" I said, \\\"What kind of a plant is it?\\\" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, \\\"You mean Lima?\\\" They said, \\\"No, sir. It's Lima.\\\" That's why\\u2026 Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, \\\"What kind of a plant?\\\" And I said, \\\"Let's go see it.\\\" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, \\\"Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here.\\\" I said\\u2026 And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, \\\"You're not closing it.\\\" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to\\u2026 They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went\\u2026 They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our\\u2026 Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do\\u2026 A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, \\\"But I could do better. I could do better.\\\" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had\\u2026 The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words \\\"Made in the USA\\\" or \\\"Made in America\\\". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God We trust.\\\" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was\\u2026 I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home.

Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to \\u2026 He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest \\u2026 Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. \\\"Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough.\\\" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, \\\"Say law and order but with safety.\\\" I said, \\\"Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?\\\" We want law and order. They say, \\\"Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's \\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"I don't want to add.\\\" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, \\\"No, we need law and order.\\\" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at \\u2026 You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way \\u2026 By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, \\\"Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?\\\" There's something really \\u2026 The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, \\\"He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting.\\\" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think \\u2026 I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that \\u2026 So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, \\\"Look, let's have 1,000 people,\\\" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed \\u2026 Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, \\\"I don't know. That's a lot of \\u2026\\\" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done \\u2026 You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. \\\"Sir, we have to be able to see through.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, let's go. Much more expensive.\\\" I said, \\\"Let's go.\\\" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, \\\"What else do you want?\\\" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, \\\"We don't want a wall, we want drones flying.\\\" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about \\u2026 We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us \\u2026 We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders \\u2026 Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, \\\"That's a big number, right?\\\" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, \\\"You know the money that your state is going to be losing?\\\" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost \\u2013 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. \\\"After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed.\\\" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, \\\"Impossible.\\\" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with\\u2026 It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, \\\"Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?\\\" He said, \\\"Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.\\\" So I said, \\\"28, okay, that's fine.\\\" I said, \\\"We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.\\\" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want\\u2026 And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. \\\"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal.\\\" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, \\\"How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.\\\" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need\\u2026 There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, \\\"There's no way he got worse than me.\\\" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to\\u2026 That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, \\\"Okay.\\\" She could have said, \\\"You got me.\\\" But she said, \\\"I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,\\\" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, \\\"I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.\\\" I said, \\\"How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?\\\" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. \\\"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.\\\" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, \\\"Walls are old fashioned. They don't work.\\\" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, \\\"Let me see that one.\\\" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, \\\"No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be\\u2026\\\" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, \\\"No, no, no, you don't have to do that.\\\" But I said, \\\"We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,\\\" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment\\u2026He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, \\\"That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,\\\" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, \\\"You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people.\\\" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- \\u2026 And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them\\u2026 We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, \\\"You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.\\\" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, \\\"Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America\\u2026 So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting\\u2026 Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some\\u2026 We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, \\\"Wow, things are going really well.\\\" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. \",\n          \"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for \\u2026 I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, \\\"You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\\\" He said, \\\"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\\\" This great congressman said, \\\"I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot.\\\" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than \\u2026 Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor \\u2026 You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, \\\"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\\\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, \\\" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters.\\\" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star \\u2026 So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, \\\"Ah, I'm out of here. Bye.\\\" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, \\\" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small.\\\" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, \\\"Rob Portman's down,\\\" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, \\\"What the Hell did you do?\\\" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, \\\"I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump.\\\" I'd never have been in\\u2026 We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" 148. And I said, \\\"You got to be kidding.\\\" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, \\\"You must win the state of Ohio.\\\" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. \\\"You must win Ohio. You must win.\\\" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, \\\"Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.\\\" I said, \\\"But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.\\\" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, \\\"We just lost.\\\" And Bob said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up.\\\" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, \\\"Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried.\\\" He said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up.\\\" He kept saying, \\\"You just went up.\\\" I said to somebody, \\\"I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.\\\" True. He said, \\\"Don't worry.\\\" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, \\\"We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world.\\\" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new\\u2026 It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get\\u2026 They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, \\\"Just sign right there.\\\" \\\"Oh, okay. I'll sign.\\\" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, \\\"I'd love to go to a rally.\\\" I said, \\\" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it.\\\" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, \\\"Would you please report back in four years from now.\\\" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens\\u2026 they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better\\u2026 I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, \\\"You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days.\\\" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, \\\"Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.\\\" I say, \\\"So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it.\\\" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, \\\"Gee, that's a good idea.\\\" They'd been working in this few years. They said, \\\"That's a good idea.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?\\\" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now\\u2026 So other countries\\u2026 Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, \\\"You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation.\\\" He said, \\\"If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%.\\\" I said, \\\"Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system\\u2026\\\" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, \\\"You know, I have a great idea.\\\" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for\\u2026 I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, \\\"I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill.\\\" And I thought\\u2026 I said, \\\"Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that.\\\" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, \\\"How do you like that idea?\\\" And they said, \\\"Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been\\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"Really? You've known about it that long?\\\" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got\\u2026 They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, \\\"Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in\\u2026 Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, \\\"We're closing this plant.\\\" I said, \\\"What kind of a plant is it?\\\" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, \\\"You mean Lima?\\\" They said, \\\"No, sir. It's Lima.\\\" That's why\\u2026 Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, \\\"What kind of a plant?\\\" And I said, \\\"Let's go see it.\\\" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, \\\"Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here.\\\" I said\\u2026 And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, \\\"You're not closing it.\\\" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to\\u2026 They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went\\u2026 They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our\\u2026 Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do\\u2026 A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, \\\"But I could do better. I could do better.\\\" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had\\u2026 The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words \\\"Made in the USA\\\" or \\\"Made in America\\\". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God We trust.\\\" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was\\u2026 I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us.

Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to \\u2026 He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest \\u2026 Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. \\\"Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough.\\\" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, \\\"Say law and order but with safety.\\\" I said, \\\"Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?\\\" We want law and order. They say, \\\"Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's \\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"I don't want to add.\\\" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, \\\"No, we need law and order.\\\" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at \\u2026 You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way \\u2026 By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, \\\"Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?\\\" There's something really \\u2026 The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, \\\"He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting.\\\" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think \\u2026 I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that \\u2026 So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, \\\"Look, let's have 1,000 people,\\\" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed \\u2026 Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, \\\"I don't know. That's a lot of \\u2026\\\" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done \\u2026 You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. \\\"Sir, we have to be able to see through.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, let's go. Much more expensive.\\\" I said, \\\"Let's go.\\\" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, \\\"What else do you want?\\\" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, \\\"We don't want a wall, we want drones flying.\\\" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about \\u2026 We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us \\u2026 We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders \\u2026 Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, \\\"That's a big number, right?\\\" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, \\\"You know the money that your state is going to be losing?\\\" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost \\u2013 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. \\\"After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed.\\\" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, \\\"Impossible.\\\" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with\\u2026 It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, \\\"Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?\\\" He said, \\\"Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.\\\" So I said, \\\"28, okay, that's fine.\\\" I said, \\\"We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.\\\" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want\\u2026 And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. \\\"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal.\\\" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, \\\"How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.\\\" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need\\u2026 There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, \\\"There's no way he got worse than me.\\\" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to\\u2026 That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, \\\"Okay.\\\" She could have said, \\\"You got me.\\\" But she said, \\\"I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,\\\" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, \\\"I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.\\\" I said, \\\"How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?\\\" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. \\\"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.\\\" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, \\\"Walls are old fashioned. They don't work.\\\" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, \\\"Let me see that one.\\\" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, \\\"No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be\\u2026\\\" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, \\\"No, no, no, you don't have to do that.\\\" But I said, \\\"We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,\\\" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment\\u2026He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, \\\"That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,\\\" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, \\\"You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people.\\\" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- \\u2026 And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them\\u2026 We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, \\\"You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.\\\" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, \\\"Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America\\u2026 So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting\\u2026 Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some\\u2026 We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, \\\"Wow, things are going really well.\\\" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. \",\n          \"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for \\u2026 I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, \\\"You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\\\" He said, \\\"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\\\" This great congressman said, \\\"I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot.\\\" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than \\u2026 Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor \\u2026 You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, \\\"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\\\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, \\\" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters.\\\" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star \\u2026 So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, \\\"Ah, I'm out of here. Bye.\\\" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, \\\" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small.\\\" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, \\\"Rob Portman's down,\\\" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, \\\"What the Hell did you do?\\\" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, \\\"I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump.\\\" I'd never have been in\\u2026 We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" 148. And I said, \\\"You got to be kidding.\\\" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, \\\"You must win the state of Ohio.\\\" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. \\\"You must win Ohio. You must win.\\\" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, \\\"Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.\\\" I said, \\\"But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.\\\" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, \\\"We just lost.\\\" And Bob said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up.\\\" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, \\\"Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried.\\\" He said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up.\\\" He kept saying, \\\"You just went up.\\\" I said to somebody, \\\"I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.\\\" True. He said, \\\"Don't worry.\\\" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, \\\"We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world.\\\" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new\\u2026 It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get\\u2026 They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, \\\"Just sign right there.\\\" \\\"Oh, okay. I'll sign.\\\" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, \\\"I'd love to go to a rally.\\\" I said, \\\" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it.\\\" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, \\\"Would you please report back in four years from now.\\\" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens\\u2026 they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better\\u2026 I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, \\\"You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days.\\\" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, \\\"Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.\\\" I say, \\\"So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it.\\\" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, \\\"Gee, that's a good idea.\\\" They'd been working in this few years. They said, \\\"That's a good idea.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?\\\" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now\\u2026 So other countries\\u2026 Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, \\\"You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation.\\\" He said, \\\"If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%.\\\" I said, \\\"Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system\\u2026\\\" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, \\\"You know, I have a great idea.\\\" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for\\u2026 I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, \\\"I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill.\\\" And I thought\\u2026 I said, \\\"Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that.\\\" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, \\\"How do you like that idea?\\\" And they said, \\\"Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been\\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"Really? You've known about it that long?\\\" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got\\u2026 They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, \\\"Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in\\u2026 Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, \\\"We're closing this plant.\\\" I said, \\\"What kind of a plant is it?\\\" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, \\\"You mean Lima?\\\" They said, \\\"No, sir. It's Lima.\\\" That's why\\u2026 Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, \\\"What kind of a plant?\\\" And I said, \\\"Let's go see it.\\\" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, \\\"Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here.\\\" I said\\u2026 And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, \\\"You're not closing it.\\\" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to\\u2026 They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went\\u2026 They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our\\u2026 Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do\\u2026 A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, \\\"But I could do better. I could do better.\\\" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had\\u2026 The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words \\\"Made in the USA\\\" or \\\"Made in America\\\". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God We trust.\\\" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was\\u2026 I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. And we all share the same love of Almighty God. Together, with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. We are making America great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep America great. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Citta\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Henderson\",\n          \"LasVegas\",\n          \"Winston-Salem\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2019-07-17 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2020-09-22 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-09-08 00:00:00\",\n          \"2020-06-20 00:00:00\",\n          \"2019-08-01 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Anno\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2019,\n        \"max\": 2020,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2019,\n          2020\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Mese\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          11,\n          12\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Giorno_mese\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 7,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 30,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          28,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Giorno_settimana\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":69}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np"],"metadata":{"id":"Fpg97EDK7Yxv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711829177276,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":230,"user":{"displayName":"John Jordan Ntamack","userId":"04516984341154908365"}}},"execution_count":70,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Capire se un giorno √® un weekend o no\n","df['Weekend'] = np.where((df.Giorno_settimana == 5) | (df.Giorno_settimana == 6), \"S√¨\", \"No\")"],"metadata":{"id":"_-E36lMf-FGY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711829299739,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":245,"user":{"displayName":"John Jordan Ntamack","userId":"04516984341154908365"}}},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"PfBmNTb6-i_J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711829302727,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":670,"user":{"displayName":"John Jordan Ntamack","userId":"04516984341154908365"}},"outputId":"602db21e-b04b-484e-fadd-fde40ebebe46"},"execution_count":72,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                            Contenuto             Citta  \\\n","0   Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to \\u2026 He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest \\u2026 Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. \\\"Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough.\\\" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, \\\"Say law and order but with safety.\\\" I said, \\\"Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?\\\" We want law and order. They say, \\\"Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's \\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"I don't want to add.\\\" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, \\\"No, we need law and order.\\\" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at \\u2026 You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way \\u2026 By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, \\\"Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?\\\" There's something really \\u2026 The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, \\\"He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting.\\\" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think \\u2026 I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that \\u2026 So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, \\\"Look, let's have 1,000 people,\\\" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed \\u2026 Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, \\\"I don't know. That's a lot of \\u2026\\\" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done \\u2026 You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. \\\"Sir, we have to be able to see through.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, let's go. Much more expensive.\\\" I said, \\\"Let's go.\\\" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, \\\"What else do you want?\\\" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, \\\"We don't want a wall, we want drones flying.\\\" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about \\u2026 We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us \\u2026 We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders \\u2026 Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, \\\"That's a big number, right?\\\" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, \\\"You know the money that your state is going to be losing?\\\" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost \\u2013 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. \\\"After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed.\\\" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, \\\"Impossible.\\\" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with\\u2026 It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, \\\"Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?\\\" He said, \\\"Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.\\\" So I said, \\\"28, okay, that's fine.\\\" I said, \\\"We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.\\\" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want\\u2026 And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. \\\"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal.\\\" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, \\\"How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.\\\" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need\\u2026 There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, \\\"There's no way he got worse than me.\\\" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to\\u2026 That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, \\\"Okay.\\\" She could have said, \\\"You got me.\\\" But she said, \\\"I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,\\\" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, \\\"I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.\\\" I said, \\\"How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?\\\" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. \\\"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.\\\" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, \\\"Walls are old fashioned. They don't work.\\\" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, \\\"Let me see that one.\\\" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, \\\"No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be\\u2026\\\" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, \\\"No, no, no, you don't have to do that.\\\" But I said, \\\"We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,\\\" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment\\u2026He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, \\\"That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,\\\" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, \\\"You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people.\\\" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- \\u2026 And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them\\u2026 We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, \\\"You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.\\\" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, \\\"Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America\\u2026 So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting\\u2026 Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some\\u2026 We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, \\\"Wow, things are going really well.\\\" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. \",\n          \"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for \\u2026 I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, \\\"You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\\\" He said, \\\"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\\\" This great congressman said, \\\"I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot.\\\" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than \\u2026 Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor \\u2026 You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, \\\"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\\\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, \\\" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters.\\\" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star \\u2026 So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, \\\"Ah, I'm out of here. Bye.\\\" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, \\\" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small.\\\" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, \\\"Rob Portman's down,\\\" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, \\\"What the Hell did you do?\\\" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, \\\"I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump.\\\" I'd never have been in\\u2026 We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" 148. And I said, \\\"You got to be kidding.\\\" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, \\\"You must win the state of Ohio.\\\" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. \\\"You must win Ohio. You must win.\\\" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, \\\"Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.\\\" I said, \\\"But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.\\\" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, \\\"We just lost.\\\" And Bob said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up.\\\" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, \\\"Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried.\\\" He said, \\\"Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up.\\\" He kept saying, \\\"You just went up.\\\" I said to somebody, \\\"I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.\\\" True. He said, \\\"Don't worry.\\\" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, \\\"We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world.\\\" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new\\u2026 It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get\\u2026 They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, \\\"Just sign right there.\\\" \\\"Oh, okay. I'll sign.\\\" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, \\\"I'd love to go to a rally.\\\" I said, \\\" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it.\\\" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, \\\"Would you please report back in four years from now.\\\" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens\\u2026 they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better\\u2026 I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, \\\"You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days.\\\" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, \\\"Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.\\\" I say, \\\"So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it.\\\" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, \\\"Gee, that's a good idea.\\\" They'd been working in this few years. They said, \\\"That's a good idea.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?\\\" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now\\u2026 So other countries\\u2026 Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, \\\"You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation.\\\" He said, \\\"If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%.\\\" I said, \\\"Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system\\u2026\\\" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, \\\"You know, I have a great idea.\\\" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for\\u2026 I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, \\\"I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill.\\\" And I thought\\u2026 I said, \\\"Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that.\\\" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, \\\"How do you like that idea?\\\" And they said, \\\"Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been\\u2026\\\" I said, \\\"Really? You've known about it that long?\\\" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got\\u2026 They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, \\\"Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in\\u2026 Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, \\\"We're closing this plant.\\\" I said, \\\"What kind of a plant is it?\\\" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, \\\"You mean Lima?\\\" They said, \\\"No, sir. It's Lima.\\\" That's why\\u2026 Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, \\\"What kind of a plant?\\\" And I said, \\\"Let's go see it.\\\" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, \\\"Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here.\\\" I said\\u2026 And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, \\\"You're not closing it.\\\" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to\\u2026 They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went\\u2026 They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our\\u2026 Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do\\u2026 A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, \\\"But I could do better. I could do better.\\\" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had\\u2026 The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words \\\"Made in the USA\\\" or \\\"Made in America\\\". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, \\\"In God We trust.\\\" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was\\u2026 I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. And we all share the same love of Almighty God. Together, with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. We are making America great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep America great. Thank you, Ohio.
